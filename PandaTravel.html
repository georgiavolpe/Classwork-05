			<h1>Punaluu Black Sand Beach</h1>
<!--First Paragraph: Explaining the Punaluu Beach and why you should go-->
				<p>The Punaluu beach dazzles its visitors with its coal-black sands and exotic flora. As vibrant groves of coconut palms surround the peaceful shore, sea turtles and birds reside nearby. The long stretch of sand serves as a perfect setting for picnics and sunbathing. Whether sunny or cloudy, the Punaluu beach is quite reserved and provides a relaxing and comfortable experience to all who visit.</p>

<!--Tourist Reviews-->
			<h2>Reviews</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>(5 Stars) My family and I went to Punaluu on a cloudy day, which meant there werent many turtles... but we saw many multi-colored ducks swim in the ponds nearby which was exciting also!</li>
					<li>(5 Stars) When I entered the beach with my husband, we were stuck by how beautiful the sand was! When the light captured it, it sparkled. Pictures couldnt do this place justice!</li>
					<li>(4 Stars) The beach is very scenic and theres a lot to look at. I hoped to swim in the water, but it wasnt very conditional for me to swim in.</li>
